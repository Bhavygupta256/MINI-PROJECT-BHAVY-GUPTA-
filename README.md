# MINI-PROJECT-BHAVY-GUPTA-
# TITLE : STORAGE BASED SAVING BY HUMAN DETECTION
## this single file recorder.py contains all the code to make this work 
## Requirements: python and opencv
## we are using pre-trained neural networks for human detection, these two files deploy.prototxt and res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel  are these only.
## we have a grace time of 5s to not split it into too many recordingd with human detection but it returns a single .mp4 file after that only when there was a human
## at the presengt moment we are not able to accomodate audio , so the recordings will be mute 
## you can see a live example when I am running it in output.py (my webcam quality is not good so the video seems to be a bit sped up , with better quality it will show better results)

# THANKS FOR VISITING.
